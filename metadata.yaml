description: '"These fifteen Lectures on the Philosophy of Life are intended to give,
  as far as is possible, a clear and succinct exposition of the following subjects.
  The first five treat of the soul, 1, as the centre of consciousness: 2, as the centre
  of moral life: 3, as co-operating with mind in the acquisition of knowledge: 4,
  in its relation to nature: 5, in its relation to God. The next three investigate
  the laws of Divine Wisdom and Providence, as manifested in the system of Nature,
  the World of Thought, and the evidences of History. The subject-matter of the remaining
  seven is the unfolding of the spirit [or spiritual nature] of man, in consciousness
  and in science; in external life and its great social relations; in its struggle
  with the age; and in its course of restoration through the several grades of human
  development, until it arrives at the end and aim of perfection. The second section
  of this book presents Lectures on the Philosophy of Language." (PsycINFO Database
